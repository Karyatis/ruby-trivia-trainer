An admission: This is way more basic of a project than it started out as. 

Originally a Rails project, I stopped working on that when I realized I was going to run out of time before I had the MVP. I realized I didn't need routes. There was going to be no need for a database. So I left Rails and even Sinatra behind. 

So I went back to the basics. A graduate of Dev Bootcamp (DBC), we learned early in the program how to write console programs in Ruby, and it was great fun to quickly write the basic functionality of this program.

Had I more time, I would probably have written this in JS (a language I haven't touched since graduating DBC) so that there user experience is more realistic. I'm bothered that there isn't a cloud platform that is hosting this that I can send you to. 

So I'm submitting what a have: A simple program that someone could run in the console and quickly play a game. In the end, my guiding priciples were KISS and YAGNI. 

To run, simply clone the repo and in the console box type and enter `ruby runner.rb`
